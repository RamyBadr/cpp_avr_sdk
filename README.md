# cpp_avr_sdk
atml studio 6.0 provides ability to develop embedded app in C++. so i started to develop asample of project in C++ for interfacing avr micro controller in OOP principles
I used basic archetecture for embedded systems : App > HAL > MCAL , but the new thing is configuring micro contoller with oo code and using design patterns like singleton to provide general wrapper for micocontroller functionalities.
Also used features in c++ to make code better like function overloading that's not available in ANSI C
The purpose of this sample is not for industry. it's just exploring features that's new for microcontroller development
